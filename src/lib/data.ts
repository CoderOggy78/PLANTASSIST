  {
    name: 'Powdery Mildew',
    effects: 'Produces white, powdery spots on leaves and stems, which can cause leaves to turn yellow and die off prematurely.',
    remedies: 'Apply neem oil, sulfur-based fungicides, or a solution of baking soda and water. Improve air circulation around plants.',
  },
  {
    name: 'Leaf Rust',
    effects: 'Causes orange to reddish-brown pustules on the undersides of leaves, reducing photosynthesis and overall plant vigor.',
    remedies: 'Use resistant crop varieties. Apply fungicides containing mancozeb or chlorothalonil. Remove and destroy infected leaves.',
  },
  {
    name: 'Bacterial Blight',
    effects: 'Creates water-soaked lesions on leaves, which eventually turn black and necrotic, leading to defoliation.',
    remedies: 'Apply copper-based bactericides. Avoid overhead watering and improve plant spacing for better airflow.',
  },
  {
    name: 'Downy Mildew',
    effects: 'Results in yellow patches on the upper surfaces of leaves and gray, fuzzy mold on the undersides. Can stunt growth.',
    remedies: 'Apply fungicides, especially those containing metalaxyl or fosetyl-al. Ensure good drainage and air circulation.',
  },
  {
    name: 'Late Blight',
    effects: 'Causes large, dark lesions on leaves and stems, and can lead to rapid rotting of fruits like tomatoes and potatoes.',
    remedies: 'Use preventative copper fungicide sprays. Destroy infected plants immediately to prevent spread.',
  },
  {
    name: 'Anthracnose',
    effects: 'Characterized by dark, sunken spots on leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits, often leading to dieback.',
    remedies: 'Prune out infected areas. Apply fungicides containing chlorothalonil or copper. Water at the base of plants.',
  },
  {
    name: 'Citrus Canker',
    effects: 'Forms raised, brown, corky lesions on leaves, stems, and fruit of citrus trees, affecting fruit quality.',
    remedies: 'Regular application of copper sprays. Use windbreaks to reduce spread. Remove severely infected trees.',
  },
  {
    name: 'Root Rot',
    effects: 'Leads to brown or black, mushy roots, causing wilting, yellowing leaves, and eventual plant death due to poor water uptake.',
    remedies: 'Improve soil drainage. Avoid overwatering. Apply a fungicide drench appropriate for the pathogen.',
  },
  {
    name: 'Fusarium Wilt',
    effects: 'Causes yellowing and wilting on one side of the plant, stunting growth and eventually killing the plant.',
    remedies: 'Plant resistant varieties. Practice soil solarization. There are no effective chemical controls for infected plants.',
  },
  {
    name: 'Black Spot',
    effects: 'Produces circular black spots with fringed margins on leaves, primarily on roses, causing them to yellow and drop.',
    remedies: 'Apply fungicides like chlorothalonil or myclobutanil. Remove and destroy infected leaves. Mulch around plants.',
  },
  {
    name: 'Mosaic Virus',
    effects: 'Creates a mottled pattern of light green, yellow, and dark green areas on leaves, stunting growth and reducing yield.',
    remedies: 'There is no cure. Remove and destroy infected plants to prevent spread. Control insect vectors like aphids.',
  },
  {
    name: 'Stem Rot',
    effects: 'Causes dark lesions at the base of the stem, often at the soil line, which can girdle and kill the plant.',
    remedies: 'Improve soil drainage. Avoid planting too deeply. Apply a fungicide drench to the soil.',
  },
  {
    name: 'White Rust',
    effects: 'Forms white, chalky blisters or pustules, usually on the undersides of leaves, causing distortion and yellowing.',
    remedies: 'Practice crop rotation. Remove infected plant material. Apply fungicides if the infection is severe.',
  },
  {
    name: 'Charcoal Rot',
    effects: 'Manifests as gray-to-black discoloration on the stem and roots, with tiny black microsclerotia inside the stem pith.',
    remedies: 'Plant resistant seeds. Practice crop rotation with non-host crops. Maintain adequate soil moisture to reduce stress.',
  },
  {
    name: 'Wilt Disease',
    effects: 'Leads to sudden wilting of the entire plant, often without initial yellowing, due to vascular system blockage.',
    remedies: 'Use resistant varieties. Soil fumigation may be necessary in commercial fields. Improve soil health.',
  },
  {
    name: 'Smut Disease',
    effects: 'Causes parts of the plant, often kernels or flowers, to transform into black, powdery fungal growths (galls).',
    remedies: 'Use treated seeds. Remove and destroy galls before they burst. Practice crop rotation.',
  },
  {
    name: 'Leaf Curl Virus',
    effects: 'Leads to severely curled, distorted, and yellowed leaves. Stunts plant growth and drastically reduces fruit production.',
    remedies: 'Control whiteflies, the primary vector. Remove infected plants. Use reflective mulches to deter whiteflies.',
  },
  {
    name: 'Blossom End Rot',
    effects: 'Causes dark, leathery spots on the blossom end of fruits like tomatoes and peppers, caused by a calcium deficiency.',
    remedies: 'Ensure consistent watering. Apply a calcium-rich foliar spray or add calcium amendments like lime to the soil.',
  },
  {
    name: 'Clubroot',
    effects: 'Results in swollen, distorted, club-shaped roots, leading to stunted growth, yellowing leaves, and wilting.',
    remedies: 'Raise soil pH to 7.2 or higher by applying lime. Practice long crop rotations. Sanitize equipment.',
  },
  {
    name: 'Gray Mold (Botrytis)',
    effects: 'Produces a fuzzy gray mold on flowers, fruits, and leaves, especially in cool, humid conditions, causing them to rot.',
    remedies: 'Improve air circulation. Reduce humidity. Remove infected parts. Apply fungicides containing fenhexamid or boscalid.',
  },
